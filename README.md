# schroeder-itdev164-p2

working example of a Gatsby/Stripe client side checkout template I've been working on 
[Orignal Repo](https://github.com/erikthetechhobo/stripe-starter)

Added the product display and a few styled components to this version of the project.

To run, create a .env.development file in the 'YourStore' folder and copy over the keys in the project submission.

To test purchases use any name, address, zip, email, and card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any legal exp and cvc code
